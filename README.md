Arcibaldo is not finished yet and it may not work as expected.

# Arcibaldo
Arcibaldo is a configurable python utility that allows to recreate Arch Linux setups real fast. It is possible to configure profiles wich will be parsed by Arcibaldo. Profiles generally set packages to install, systemd units to be enabled, groups the user should be added to and configuration files to be created on the system (.zshrc for example)

# How to
Simply clone this repository, then you can edit file inside Config to setup things you like, or you can just run Arcibaldo and it will already have a couple pre-configured profiles.
